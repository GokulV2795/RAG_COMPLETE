Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It’s one of the most popular languages in the world, powering applications in data science, artificial intelligence, web development, automation, cloud computing, and more.

🧠 Key Characteristics of Python

High-level – You write code closer to human language, not machine language.

Interpreted – You don’t need to compile it; Python executes line by line.

Dynamically typed – You don’t have to declare variable types explicitly.

Object-oriented – Supports classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

Cross-platform – Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.

Open-source – Free to use and has a massive community.

🧰 Common Uses of Python
Domain	Example Use
Data Science & Machine Learning	Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
Web Development	Django, Flask
Automation/Scripting	Automating tasks (file handling, web scraping)
Artificial Intelligence	NLP, computer vision, generative AI
Game Development	Pygame
Cloud & DevOps	AWS SDK (Boto3), Azure SDK
Cybersecurity	Ethical hacking scripts, penetration testing
Finance	Quant analysis, forecasting models
💬 Simple Python Example
# Hello World Program
print("Hello, World!")

# Variables and Arithmetic
a = 10
b = 5
sum = a + b
print("Sum:", sum)

# Function Example
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Gokul"))


Output:

Hello, World!
Sum: 15
Hello, Gokul!
